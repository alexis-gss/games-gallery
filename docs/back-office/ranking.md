# ðŸ¥‡ Ranking

In order to fill in the ranking page we saw earlier, a dedicated section has been created in the back-office.

This page operates differently from a CRUD. It consists of a selection field for existing games. The user can search for games by keyword, and then select them to add them to the list below.

Once done, a drag-and-drop system is used to reorganize all the items in the list. Each time a modification is made, an ajax call is executed to save directly to the database without having to constantly refresh the page.

Each modification to a data model triggers a new entry in the project activity log.
