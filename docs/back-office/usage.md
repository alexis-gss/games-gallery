# üè† Usage

All content in the back office is subject to authentication.

Indeed, to manage this project, you need **to log in** to a previously created account. In this way, only specific people can access and edit data.

## Navigation

Once logged in, the user accesses the [Games Gallery](https://games-gallery.alexis-gousseau.com/) back office. It is divided into several distinct sections, which can be found in the navigation at the top of the page.&#x20;

In the latter, we can also find several functionalities such as changing **the back-office theme**, **language selection** and user **account management**, which we'll look at later.

## Home page

The first part of this navigation is simply a back-office home page, summarizing the back-office capabilities. In addition, you can find 3 links related to this project:

* the first is **the project site** in production with real data entered,
* the second is **the link to the documentation** you are currently working on,
* and the last link redirects to **the project's source code** hosted on my github profile.

Now let's take a look at how to enter new data into the project using the various [CRUDs](cruds.md).
