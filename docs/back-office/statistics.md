# ðŸ“Š Statistics

The back office of this [Games Gallery](https://games-gallery.alexis-gousseau.com/) project contains a multitude of data. That's why I wanted to set up a statistics section to give administrators an overview of all this information.

## Distribution

First, we find **the last entry** in each [CRUDs](cruds.md). Whether it's **a user**, **a folder**, **a game** or even **a tag**, we can see its name as well as the date and time of the change:

Next come the graphs showing the distribution of associations between data models. We have :

* a diagram tracking **project activities** over the last month :

* a bar chart showing **the number of games per tags** :

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (2).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Games Gallery - graph of games by tags</p></figcaption></figure>

* a pie chart showing **the total number of games per folder** :

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (3).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Games Gallery - graph of games by folders</p></figcaption></figure>

As for the last part, it's simply **a top 5 of the most liked images** from the project :

Since only one person worked on it, project management was necessary to centralize ideas, bugs and evolutions.
