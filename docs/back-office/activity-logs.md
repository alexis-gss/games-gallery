# üóûÔ∏è Activity logs

This part of the project involves monitoring back-office activity on data models (previously discussed in the [CRUDs](cruds.md) section).

## Modifications

In this project, I've installed one of my packages called [Laravel Activity Logs](https://docs-laravel-activity-logs.alexis-gousseau.com/), which allows us to track **the author of each action**, **the target**, **the date** and all **the values modified** by the user. In this way, accounts with the designer role can track changes in detail and act accordingly.

When new activities are entered, this means that there have been changes concerning [CRUDs](cruds.md).

In order to have an overall view of the data stored in the database, I have created the [Statistics](statistics.md) page, which allows administrators to view the data in graphical form.
