# ðŸ¥‡ Ranking

Given the multitude of games I've been able to complete, I've developed a preference for some of them.

That's what this page is all about, **highlighting some games** against others. Indeed, whether it's the game itself or the screenshots I've taken, I wanted to create a ranking to compare them.

I've therefore opted for a position-based ranking of the best games I've played, which concludes the pages accessible to any average user.
