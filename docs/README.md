# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome

Welcome to the documentation for my [Games Gallery](https://games-gallery.alexis-gousseau.com/) project.

Thanks to the latter, you'll learn not only the main purpose of this project, but also the procedures to follow **to install**, **configure**, **customize** and **feed this project** on your own.

## Introduction

As you might have guessed, this project is an **online image gallery**.

The aim was to collect a multitude of screenshots in one place. These come from my gaming sessions, which I was able to take throughout my free time. These are images taken during cinematics, gameplay phases or even a photo mode, from several games I've completed with the greatest of pleasure.
